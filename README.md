# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

This project is a machine learning application that predicts whether a student will **Pass** or **Fail** based on input features (e.g., scores, hours studied, etc.). It includes a simple interactive **Streamlit** web app for user input and prediction display.

## 💡 Project Overview

- ✅ Trained a classification model using scikit-learn
- ✅ Saved the model using `pickle`
- ✅ Built a user-friendly UI using Streamlit
- ✅ Deployed locally using `streamlit run app.py`

---
## 💡 Accuracy for different Classification Algorithms:
- ✅ Logistic Regression = 50%
- ✅ Support Vector Machine = 50%
- ✅ Decision Tree = 48%
- ✅ Random Forest Classifier = 57%
- ✅ KNearestNeighbors = 51%
